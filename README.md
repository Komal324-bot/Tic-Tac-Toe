# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game that we used to play as kids .

Thsi si a simple game of tic tac toe that I created by using javascript,HTML and CSS. Most of the games I have seen online require two players, and I wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against the computer.



- Add a win counter
- Allow the human to choose whether to play as X or O
- Have the computer make funny remarks with each play/win
